# Welcome to the readme file of the Battery Construction and Cell Testing (BCCT) team of the FlowerPower group. 

### The group consists of the following members:
- Bram van de Zande 
- Evdoxia Karagianni 
- Steven Bos

### This readme file consists of information regarding our project.
The project is part of the FlowerPower group which is part of the UED2021 course making a FAIR flow battery at the University Utrecht. 

The project canvas file consists of the goals we will try to achieve in this project and also a brief summary of the quantative results we would like to measure and what kind of equipment we will need for this project. 

In this project we will focus on the construction of a redox flow battery and the testing of the battery cell.
The construction of the battery will be documented in this git repository such that it is an open source project, accessible to everybody trying to improve on such batteries. 

The other goal for this project is to do quantative research on battery cells. More specifically on the volume size between the membrane and cathode and how that affects the pressure difference between ingoing and outgoing fluid flow, and the amount of current produced by the battery cell.

### Update: 01/11/2021
These goals weren't fully met but we did important progress and we learned a lot! So the ultimate goal was achieved!! :)

### Take a step in our shoes!
You can reproduce our measurements and experiments! Just go to the Reproducibility directory and follow the instructions! Don't forget to take a look at the pictures in our Images directory.
