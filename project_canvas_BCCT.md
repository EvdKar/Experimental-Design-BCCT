PROJECT NAME:Battery construction and cell testing (BCCT)
PROJECT OWNERS:Bram van de Zande, Evdoxia Karagianni, Steven Bos

## 1- Project elements (fill this at the start of the course)

### We expect to achieve:
We want to construct a working redox flow battery. Also we want to find a relation of flow through the battery cell, and fluid pressure, and how it affects the current of the battery.
What are we going to build: A redox flow battery, and use a battery cell connected to a pressure measurement device. We will change the amount of gaskets surrounding the electrode, to differ the amount of volume available for the fluid to flow through. We will also attach an amperage meter.

### What will we measure:
The pressure of the electrolyte fluid before and after passing through the battery cell, for different gasket volume sizes.  Then we will also measure the current to see how it is affected by the changes in pressure difference.

### Quantative goals:
We want to find a relation with the volume of the gaskets, and the pressure difference between input and ouput. And see how that affects the amount of current passing through the cell.
Specify output data: A pressure difference between input flow and output flow such that we can see how the gasket volume relates with the flow speed of the fluid through the gasket, and we want to measure the amount of current of the cell.


#### 1.1- Problem

The amount of fluid flowing through the gasket volume has influenced on the amount of ions being able to pass through the membrane. To find out what makes the total battery cell more efficient, we will address the problem of gasket volume size dependence of the flow through rate.

#### 1.2- Solution

We will try different sizes for the gasket volume, such that we can see how that affects the pressure difference on the input and output flow of fluid, and thus the amount of ions passing through the membrane. 

#### 1.3- Boundaries and milestones

If we find an significant amount of change in the current due to the considered pressure changes, we consider the project a success. 

#### 1.4- Resources required

1. battery cell
2. pressure measurement device
3. the appropriate electrolyte (NaCl, with Fe2(SO4)3 active material)
4. amperage meter
5. pumps
6. valves
7. little pipes (continoues ones, and ones with a split).


## 2- Embedding in the community 
As of 24/10/2021:
1. We didn't manage to measure the pressure inside the cell, since the first cell attempt was quite failed, since there was a lot of leakage.
2. We were able to calibrate the pressure measuring device and take a reference measurement of the pipes system. Read Documentation.md [subprojects/FlowerPower_BramEvaSteven/Documentation.md] file
3. With the help of the other team we created a new cell, which is not leaking.
4. We plan on testing if it can be used in a WORKING battery.

#### 2.1 Unique value proposition
*A clear message that state what you offer to the team project and why your contribution is essential* 

#### 2.2 Connection
*Identify the other projects that you will directly interact with and mention the agreements you need to make with those players.*  

## 3- Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
*Evaluate the project performance based on the interaction with the other projects. State what changes are necessary and which goals had to be adjusted.*
