# Experiment Design 2020

## Symposium self-reflection

project, team: BCCT

The purpose of this self-reflection is to learn from the exercise of presenting your project to a public audience. Answer the preparation questions **before** the online symposium and evaluate them based on your experience **after** the end of the symposium

## Preparation

### Content: 
+	What makes your pitch attractive?
In our pitch we will talk about redox flow batteries in general, why they are important, what promises they give and our experience of making one.
We want to communicate our sustainability and reproducibility goals. We won't go much into detail, instead we are going to tell a story and at the end of the talk the visitor will have positive feeling about this kind of batteries. 
+	What do you want the visitors to learn from your pitch?
1. The advantages of redox flow batteries
2. The specs of our battery
+	What elements have you deliberately put in your presentation to reach your goal?
1. A storyline to make the pitch more fun
2. An awesome poster, with attactive pictures and not too much text.
3. Positive attitude and general vibe


### Performance:
+	What is **your** goal of presenting your pitch?
To make people interested
+	What do you want the visitors to remember after coming to your discussion room?
1. Why redox flow batteries are important.
2. That it is possible to built a accessible battery that will solve energy problems in remote communities.
+	Which indicators show to you that your visitors are engaged with your message?
If they stay after we finish our pitch for questions and discussion.

## Evaluation
+ 1.	What worked well about your pitch and presentation?
+ 2.	What did not work as you expected?
