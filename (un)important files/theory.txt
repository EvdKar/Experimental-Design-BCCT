Theory of Pressure measurement

For the measurement of the pressure drop over the battery cell, we will first measure pressure drop on a tube of length L.
The theory gives the following formula: 
$\delta P = \lambda L / D \rho / 2 \omega ^2$

\delta P Pressure drop (Pa)
\lambda pipe friction coefficient 
L length of pipe (m)
D Pipe Diameter (m)
\rho fluid density (kg/m^3)
\omega flow velocity (m/s)

The pressure drop relates to the incoming pressure P_1 and outgoing pressure P_2 as follows:
\delta P = (P_1 ^2 - P_2 ^2)/2 P_1
