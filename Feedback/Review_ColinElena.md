## Report 

### Documentation:

1.	Could you understand the purpose of the experiment?
Yes, the measurement is a reference measurement for a flow cell. It is important to meausure the pressure dropoff. 
2.	Were the safety instructions clear?
There were no specific safety instructions, but they were only working with demi water. So it is perfectly fine.
3.  Was the starting point and the expected duration of the measurements clear in the documentation?
The expected duration was not specified. The first few steps were clear.
4.	Does the documentation contain all necessary information to successfully reproduce the measurement? If not, what was missing?
A more detailed discription of the first measurement setup could be given. The steps that prevent air bubbles from forming in the tubes were missing. We had to use a wider tube and a very narrow tube inside the wider tube to let the air flow out. For the second experiment the details were sufficient enough to reproduce the measurement. 
5.	Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?
Yes, for the first measurement we needed to use a wider tube to prevent air bubbles distorting the measurement. 
6.	Are you encouraged to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?
Yes and we could easily navigate through the documentation as well.
7.	What can be improved in the documentation?
Additional or improved schematics/pictures of the first setup could be provided. It would be more convenient to split the material section into two, one for each measurement. For the first measurement it could be helpful to write steps that help preventing air bubbles forming in the hanging tube.  

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the documentation? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

#### Documentation grade: 2.5
Even tough there could be some improvements the report was very clear and detailed in most parts. The theory section is sufficient to understand the background and aim of the measurement. The results are displayed well and they also help to verify our own results. The provided Mathematica code works perfectly as well. 

### Measurements:

1.	Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions?
For most parts, yes. For the first measurement it was not clear that we had to use a wider tube and that we had to use a very narrow tube to let the air out. If that is also stated in the report everything is very clear.
2.	How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?
We see the same trends but our values are overall higher. For second experiment we have a small dip at 3 mL/min.
3.	Is the analysis procedure easy to understand? Summarize it briefly in your own words.
What is done in the code is well explained in the theory, but the code does everything automatically which makes it very easy to operate. 
4.	Is the setup robust and safe to operate? 
Yes.
5.	Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those issues without contacting the owners?
Yes, for the first experiment we had to contact the owners.
6.	What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?
The second setup was very easy to build and therefore much appreciated.

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the measurements reproducibility? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

#### Reproducibility grade: 2
The measurements are easy to reproduce if the documentation would have been a little more specific. Even tough we got higher values we still saw the same trends. This could be due to a calibration difference. The provided code was very easy to use and it was specified what we had to change within the code.

### Interactions:

1.	If you had to perform work on this part of the project, would you have selected the same goal or aimed at something else? Please, explain.
Yes, the goal was to build a battery which unfortunately they didn't succeed. The measurements that they chose to perform gives useful information for future battery performance. 
2.	Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?
More information about the first setup. We've mentoined the missing steps in the documentation section.
3.	Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?
Yes. In the end the pressure dropoff as function of flow rate is measured. This means that now we know what the optimal flow rate is within the measured limits such that the battery works more efficienctly. 
4.	What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?
Add the steps that prevent air bubbles forming in the wider tube. Also it could be useful to add a picture instead of a schematic for the first measurement. Maybe specify the materials for the different measurements seperately.

### Response to reviewers

_This part must be filled by the project owners based on the peer feedback_

1.  Which major adjustments did you make based on this feedback?
We are going to add some details in the documentation, such as the expected duration and some missing steps. 

2.  Do you agree with the graded assessment of the reviewer?
Yes, the graded assesment was pretty accurate.

On the scale of 1-5 (1: really helpful, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the peer evaluation? Please explain.
Grade: 1
We found it really helpful in order to make our documentation more user friendly.

#Thank you Colin and Elena!!
